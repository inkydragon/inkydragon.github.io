### How this book is organized

We'll begin our tour of NVDA by meeting NVDA's creators, Mick Curran and Jamie Teh. We'll then learn about its history, what sets this screen reader apart and what to expect after finishing this book.

Part 1, "Welcome to NVDA", provides an overview of NVDA's features, such as various NVDA menus, object navigation and accessibility API handlers.

Part 2, "Screen reading and NVDA 101", provides an overview of screen readers, its history and screen reading basics. You'll then be introduced to modules and dependencies that powers NVDA.

Part 3, "Objects and accessibility representatives", provides an introduction to NVDA's view of controls on screen, as well as an overview of various accessibility API handlers used in NVDA, such as IAccessible, UIA and so on.

Part 4, "Virtual buffers and content presentation", gives a tour of what a virtual buffer is and various virtual buffer implementations. You'll also learn how NvDA uses speech and braille to communicate screen content.

Part 5, "Interface, debugging, add-ons and conclusions", examines GUI components such as various preferences dialogs. You'll then be treated to an overview on how to debug various components of NVDA, as well as miscellaneous topics such as localization and add-ons. We'll conclude our tour with various appendices, such as advanced topics and NVDA's installation, startup and shutdown routines.

This book is loosely based on NVDA's own user guide and technical overview document, both of which can be found on NVDA Community portal at http://community.nvda-project.org.
